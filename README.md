Who don't like [squirrels](http://squirrel-lang.org/)? They're so cute!

> "Squirrel is a high level imperative, object-oriented programming language, designed to be a light-weight scripting language that fits in the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of applications like video games."

# Getting started
I personally recommend using vscode for playing with squirrel lang

You can install [this extenstion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monkeygroover.vscode-squirrel-lang) to enable the syntax highlight.

Hit ctrl+shift+b (or cmd+shift+b on macos) to run currently opened file.

You can find more useful informations about the language [here](http://squirrel-lang.org/squirreldoc/)
